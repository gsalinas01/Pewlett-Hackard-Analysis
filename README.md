# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
  * The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This analysis will help prepare the manager at Pewlett Hackard for the “silver tsunami” as many employees reach retirement age.
## Results
  * Deliverable 1:
    * 'Retiring Titles' table that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955.
    * Clean list of number of employees by titles that are upcoming for retirement.

## Summary
  * 90,398 roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact. 
  * Of the 90,398 employees that are nearing their eligibility for retirement only 1,549 qualify to mentor the succeeding employees. 
  * This means that in order to replace all 90k+ employees there would have to be one mentor per about 58 new employees, which is not very feasible.
